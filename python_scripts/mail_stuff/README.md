imapcopy.py is a little python script i wrote to copy mails from googlemail to another mailserver, it's easy to use, only problem: i don't know how to always get the right date and time.. most of the mails are copied with correct date and time but some have just the current timestamp

imapdeduplicate.py is a little python script i wrote to remove duplicates of mails in an imap folder

imapmarkread.py is a little python script i wrote to mark all mails as read in an imap folder

imaplist.py is a little python script i wrote to list all mailboxes on an imap server

imaparchive.py was an attempt on an imap archiving/sorting script.. it kinda works.. a bit..

generate_whitelist.py (UNTESTED) takes all email adresses from your OS X adress book and writes a "whitelist" as sieve script which moves anything, that isn't from your contacts, to a folder "Not Important" (has to exist!)
